# Communication

Communication is very very important.

When you start a project, if you do this all you own, I guess maybe the result maybe not so good, but with communication you can get the 
opinions of others, and you maybe find some mistake or other things that you donot consider.

If you have any question, tell us and we are a team, we can solve it together.

So try to communicate with others, GO!
